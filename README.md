# DIABETES-PREDICTION
Prediction of diabetes disease using machine learning algorithms

Diabetes is a chronic disease which affects the metabolism of people of all age 
In this project , the diabetes disease is predicted using various machine learning algorithms such as classification and regression algorithms.
It is aimed to develop a model which could predict the diabetes disease at a higher accuracy and we use several alorithms such as logistic regression,decision trees,Random Forest classifier,KNN etc .
THis project is fully employed in jupyter notebook and several python packages had been used
